# Filter video by object Action

`Filter video by object Action` layer is used to route videos down either the "True" or "False" branch, depending on specific class inclusion and exclusion criteria. Users can define "include" classes, representing objects that should be present in the video for it to be directed to the "True" branch, and "exclude" classes, ensuring that videos containing unwanted objects are directed to the "False" branch.

### Settings

- **Include classes** - list classes that SHOULD be present on the video
- **Exclude classes** - list classes that SHOULD NOT be present on the video
