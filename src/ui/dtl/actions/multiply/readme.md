# Multiply

`Multiply` layer duplicates the image and annotations (multiplying by a given value).

This layer is useful when we are going to balance or unbalance data in training dataset.

### Settings:

- **Multiply number** - Set the value to multiply by. For example, if you set the value to 2, then the image and annotations will be duplicated twice.

## Example. Multiply images

For example, we have project with two datasets:

- "cats dataset" with 200 images of cats
- "dogs dataset" with 600 images of dogs.

We are going to prepare training dataset for cat-dog classifier and we want to have **equal number of images** of cats and dogs.
In this case we will use 2 `Images Project` nodes for each dataset and 1 `Multiply` node for "cats dataset" with value 3. After that we will join two datasets into resulting project using `New project` node.

As a result we will have will have 600 images of cats and 600 images of dogs.
