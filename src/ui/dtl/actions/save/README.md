# Export Archive

`Export Archive` layer allows to export annotations and images. Annotations are stored in `.json` files. Images are stored in `.png` or `.jpg` files (due to format of source image). When exporting annotations, `meta.json` file containing all used classes for project is also exported.

All data will be exported to `Team Files` and can be simply downloaded by link.

Moreover, you can get visual representations of all annotated objects on top of your images by setting visualize to true.

As a result, an archive with Supervisely project structure will be created in `Team Files`.
It contains the following:

- **ann** folder — contains json annotations for each image
- **img** folder — contains raw images
- `meta.json` file containing all project meta

### Settings

- **Archive name** - Input the name for the resulting archive.
- checkbox **Visualize** — if `true` visual representations of all annotated objects are generated. `Bitmap` objects are drawn without modifications, `polygons` are filled with color associated with the class, for `rectangles` only borders are drawn.

### Example

If `visualize` attribute is set to `true` then for each images corresponding visualizations are generated.
