# Merge Classes

`Merge Classes` layer allows merging multiple source classes into target classes. Source classes will be converted to target classes and removed from the project meta.

- Only classes with the same shape type can be merged, e.g. bitmap -> bitmap, polygon -> polygon, rectangle -> rectangle, etc.
- Doesn't support `AnyShape` geometries

All object tags from source classes will be preserved.

### Settings

- **Classes Mapping** â€” Select the source classes and specify the target classes into which they should be merged.

### Example

In this example we will merge several animal classes into a single class:
