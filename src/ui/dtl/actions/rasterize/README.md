# Rasterize

`Rasterize` layer converts all geometry figures to bitmaps and rasterizes objects on the image. (i.e. one pixel will belong to only one object)

During labeling objects are treated as layers. **Objects order matters and defines final visualization**.
This layer is useful when you need to prepare datasets for semantic segmentation model training (every pixel on the image have to belong to a single class).

### Settings

- **Classes** â€” Select classes to rasterize. If no classes are selected, all objects will be preserved.

### Example

Let's see the example below. First labeled object is `road`, second object is `car`. We labeled them separately. Now some image pixels (`car` object area) belong to two objects simultaneously (to `road` and `car`).

**Before**:

In labeling inteface we label objects as layers and now we have the following order: `road` is above `car`.
Note that you should **specify the order of objects with intersections** in labeling tool (it is important for the result).
Select classes to rasterize in settings of `Rasterize` layer.
Next we apply `Rasterize` layer to rasterize objects, it means that **every pixel uder objects will belong to only one object**.  

**After rasterization**:
