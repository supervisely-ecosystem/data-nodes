# Filter image by object Action

`Filter image by object Action` layer is used to route images down either the "True" or "False" branch, depending on specific class inclusion and exclusion criteria. Users can define "include" classes, representing objects that should be present in the image for it to be directed to the "True" branch, and "exclude" classes, ensuring that images containing unwanted objects are directed to the "False" branch.
