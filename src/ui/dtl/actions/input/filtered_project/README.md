# Filtered Project

`Filtered Project` layer is a special layer that can be added only via filters menu of the project page. This layer contains information about filtered entities from a project and can be used in the next layers of the transformation process.

## How to use:

1. Select filtered images
2. Press Run pipeline button and select template

> âœ… Don't worry, your original project will remain safe in your workspace. Any changes you make using all the layers will not affect source project, unless you use `Move` layer that will move filtered entities to another project and remove them from the source project.
